### Item List Tab
The "Item List" tab is where you store the items you commonly perform. It acts as a repository for the tasks you commonly do on a day-to-day basis. 

### Schedule Tab
The "Schedule" tab holds your schedule/to-do list for the day. It is designed to be quickly and easily populated by selecting common items from your Item List during the scheduling process. You can also add one-off items, start/end times, and mark them as complete.
